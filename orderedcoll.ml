Problem 1: Implementing ORDERED_COLLECTION with binary search trees

BinSTree is a *functor*, which takes an argument C, a module that
implements the COMPARABLE signature (from the Order module). BinSTree
ultimately must return a module which matches the ORDERED_COLLECTION
signature.

Now that we are passing in a COMPARABLE module, which separately
defines a type and comparison for that type, we can just implement
something matching ORDERED_COLLECTION's signature in terms of that
type and comparison function, and can wait until later to actually say
what that type and comparison function are.

Here, you'll complete the implementation of the BinSTree
functor. Unlike a binary search tree you may have seen before, this
implementation keeps a list with each node in the tree that contains
each instance of the value inserted into the tree. For example, if the
integer `3` is inserted into an `int BinSTree` five times, then there
will be a node with `[3; 3; 3; 3; 3]` in the tree, and the node will
only be removed after five deletions of `3` (assuming no further
intermediate insertions of `3`).
......................................................................*)

module BinSTree (C : COMPARABLE)
              : (ORDERED_COLLECTION with type elt = C.t) =
  struct
    (* Inside of here, you can use C.t to refer to the type defined in
       the C module (which matches the COMPARABLE signature), and
       C.compare to access the function that compares elements of
       type C.t *)
    exception Empty
    exception NotFound
    
    (* Grab the type of the tree element from the module C that's
       passed in.  This is the only place you explicitly need to use
       C.t; you should use elt everywhere else *)
    type elt = C.t
     
    (* The type for a collection, a binary search tree *)
    type tree =
      | Leaf
      | Branch of tree * elt list * tree

    let empty = Leaf

    insert x t -- Inserts an element `x` into the tree `t`.  The left
    subtree of a given node should only have "smaller" elements than
    that node, while the right subtree should only have
    "greater". Remember that "equal" elements should all be stored in
    a list. *The most recently inserted elements should be at the
    front of the list so they can be preferentially found and
    deleted.* (This is important for later use in priority queues.)
    
    Hint: Use `C.compare`. See `delete` for inspiration.

    `false` otherwise.  Hint: multiple values might compare `Equal` to

    tree.

    (* pull_min t -- A useful function for removing the node (list of
       elements) with the minimum value from a binary tree, returning
       that node and the tree with that node removed.
    
       The `pull_min` function is not defined in the signature
       ORDERED_COLLECTION.  When you're working on a structure that
       implements a signature like ORDERED_COLLECTION, you may write
       auxiliary functions for your implementation (such as
       `pull_min`) that are not defined in the signature.
    
       Note, however, that if a function `foo` *is* defined in a
       signature `BAR`, and you attempt to make a structure satisfying
       the signature `BAR`, then you *must* define the function `foo`
       in your structure.  Otherwise the compiler will complain that
       your structure does not, in fact, satisfy the signature `BAR`
       (but you claim that it does). So, if it's in the signature, it
       needs to be in the structure. But if it's in the structure, it
       doesn't necessarily need to show up in the signature. *)

the `BinSTree` functor, which expects a module to be passed in as an

can give the module a different type), and you should use this call to
a functor as an example for how to test modules further down in the
