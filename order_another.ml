(* Contains more COMPARABLE modules for autograding testing purposes; note that
StringLengthCompare's generate_lt doesn't work very well repeatedly for
generating trees to test -- after a while the only string you can shorten to
 is "", and we wouldn't be able to expect all of these ""'s to be stored
 higher than each other in a BST created using StringLengthCompare. *)

(* Yet another example implementation of the COMPARABLE module type for
strings. It uses string length in comparisons as opposed to alphabetical order.
This is to catch students' mistaken use of OCaml's built in comparison or < > =
functions -- and we're using string length precisely to circumvent them
(they are incredibly polymorphic). *)
